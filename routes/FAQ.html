    	<h3 class="">What equipment or software do I need for CryptoLeague?</h3>
    	<p class="lead text-muted">Buying and trading CryptoLeague artworks requires three things:
        <ul class="text-muted">
          <li >A computer (desktop or laptop) with a Chrome or Firefox browser installed.</li>
          <li >A MetaMask digital wallet</li>
          <li >Ether, the cryptocurrency used to buy CryptoLeague artworks</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <br> 

      <h3 class="">How do I install MetaMask?</h3>
      <p class="lead text-muted"> In order to buy artworks and sell your artworks, you’ll need to install digital wallet MetaMask on your Chrome or Firefox browser and load it up with ether.
        <ul class="text-muted">
          <li >Go to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en"> chrome web store</a> and click “Add to Chrome”. Or, go to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/">firefox store</a> and click “Add to Firefox”.</li>
          <li >Click “Add Extension” on the pop-up.</li>

      <h3 class="">How do I add ether to my MetaMask wallet?</h3>
      <p class="lead text-muted">There are two ways to add ether to your wallet. If you don’t currently own ether, you can:
        <ul class="text-muted">
          <li >Buy ether directly in MetaMask. This is only possible for US citizens.</li>
          <li >Purchase ether through a Coinbase wallet, another type of digital wallet, and then transfer the ether to your MetaMask wallet using the Coinbase widget.</li>
        </ul>
        <span class="text-muted">If you currently own ether, you can: Transfer your ether from your existing digital wallet to your MetaMask wallet. Just copy your MetaMask address, open up Coinbase, and click on the “Accounts” option. Click the “Send” button, paste your MetaMask address in the box, add the amount of ether you want to transfer, and complete the transaction.</span>

      <h3> So, what exactly is the CryptoLeague?</h3>
      <p class="lead text-muted">CryptoLeague are digital artworks that pay homage to the modern-day superheroes who are building our decentralized future.</p>
      <p class="text-muted">CryptoLeague artworks are unique and have been crafted by a wide variety of artists from all corners of the globe. There is only one artwork per blockchain figuredhead – once owned, it 100% belongs to you and cannot be stolen or destroyed. CryptoLeague artworks are ERC-721 non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, with the added possibility to trade percentages of them.</p>
      <p class="text-muted">75% of all proceeds from our initial auctions are sent to projects like Coin Center, the Ethereum Foundation, MyCrypto, Etherscan, Infura etc.</p>
      <p class="text-muted">All proceeds made on the secondary markets are kept by the seller. Cryptoleague takes a small percentage (3%) of each transaction that takes place on our website.</p>

      <br>

      <h3 class="">How do I buy a CryptoLeague artwork?</h3>
      <p class="lead text-muted">Head on over to the CryptoLeague Auction page, scroll through the artworks, and click on "Buy" if you see a piece you’re interested in. You’ll need to have enough ether in your MetaMask wallet to cover the transaction; once you follow through the prompts and transfer the funds, you’re the official owner of an artwork.</p>

      <br>

      <h3 class="">How much do CryptoLeague artworks cost?</h3>
      <p class="lead text-muted">All CryptoLeague artworks are initially auctioned using a descending price mechanism over a fifteen day period.</p>
      <p class="text-muted">
      Once owned, CryptoLeague artworks (or fractions of them) can then be auctioned in the secondary marketplace. Owners set their own starting price when they sell their artwork and the price goes down (in equal increments over time, unlike the initial auction) until the secondary auction ends or the artwork is purchased by another owner. Putting an artwork up for sale is a transaction on the blockchain, so you must pay some gas (a tiny fee).</p>

      <br>

      <h3 class="">How often are new CryptoLeague artworks released?</h3>
      <p class="lead text-muted">The CryptoLeague team will release a new artwork every 12 hours (subject to change).</p>

      <br>

      <h3 class="">Can I use my normal currency (USD, EUR, RMB, etc.) to buy CryptoLeague artworks?</h3>
      <p class="lead text-muted">Sorry, no... CryptoLeague is run on the same blockchain technology used by Ethereum, ether is the only currency you can use to purchase artworks. You can convert your standard currency into ether through an exchange or directly through your MetaMask wallet (depending on where you live).</p>

      <br>

      <h3 class="">How can partial ownership of an ERC-721 token occur?</h3>
      <p class="lead text-muted">We're glad you asked! Our smart contract enables each artwork to be owned by up to 100 different addresses (ie: artworks can be sold in portions down to the 1/100th) - the ownership structure of each artwork/token can be found on both the blockchain and our website.</p> 
      <p class="text-muted">
      The ERC-721 token was originally designed to only be owned by a single address however we've amended the protocol to allow multiple addresses to own fractions of each artwork/token.</p>

      <p class="text-muted">We're hopeful that our amended protocol will be lead for other projects, and that it becomes a standard and other, external marketplaces will also show fractional ownership structures of ERC-721 tokens but in the meantime, you can always utilize our website and marketplace to see fractional ownership of CryptoLeague artworks. You don't need to trust us though as it's all on the blockchain!</p>

      <br>

      <h3 class="">I just bought 50% of the artwork, am I the majority owner?</h3>
      <p class="lead text-muted">In the event that two addresses have equal ownership of the artwork, the majority owner will be the address which has the longest held over the fraction of the artwork.</p>

      <br>

      <h3 class="">Does being the majority owner of an artwork grant you any special benefits?</h3>
      <p class="lead text-muted">Apart from bragging rights, being the majority token holder ensures that your address will show up as the 'owner' of the artwork on other marketplaces that haven't adopted our improvement of the ERC-721 standard.</p>
      <p class="text-muted">If you're not the majority owner and don't see your address on these websites, don't stress! Your ownership of the artwork is stored on the ethereum blockchain and can always be viewed on our website and etherscan.</p>

      <br>

      <h3 class="">Is this a scam?</h3>
      <p class="lead text-muted">No, we're passionate about blockchain technology and this is our passion project where we can give back to the community. Artworks can be bought by anyone, and three non-profits and infrastructure projects receive 75% of the proceeds of each initial auction.</p>

      <br>

      <h3 class="">Where (TF) is the Satoshi artwork?!</h3>
      <p class="lead text-muted">Satoshi Nakomoto will be the 1,000th artwork to be auctioned on CryptoLeague. We can't wait either...</p>

      <br>

      <h3 class="">How do I reach the CryptoLeague team?</h3>
